## MIS Introduction

So you want to be an Engineer. You need to use, understand, and be
comfortable with information technology.  This is the course for that.

### Introduction to IT

*Outline*
 * Welcome and personal introduction
 * Motivation for the class (information technology and computational engineering)
 * Syllabus
 * Discussion
 * What is IT
 * Hands on with secure shell.

*Reading*
 * Class Syllabus
 * Chapter 1/Introduction of ISBB (https://bus206.pressbooks.com/chapter/chapter-1/)

*Discussion*
 * What does IT mean to you?
 * What about technology  things would you like 


Information Technology (IT), and by extension Management Information
Systems (MIS), is the **physical**, **computational**, and **software**,
infrastructure built by **teams**, to manage **information**.

IT needs **physical** infrastructure consisting of
 * power, 
 * cooling,
 * and space,

to supports the fundamental **computational** resources 
 * compute,
 * storage, and
 * networking.

From these resources a **software** system is built through
 * provisioning (physical and logical), 
 * configuration,
 * software (Operating System, libraries, applications), and
 * security.

This infrastructure is used to **manage information** (data) through 
 * business process,
 * data,
 * policy, and
 * security.

All this is all brought together by **teams** with 
 * people,
 * process, and
 * community.

** Security a fundamental property of systems and applications.

*Hands on*
 * Use a secure shell client and connect to `tc.rnet.missouri.edu`
 * Windows users can install MobaXterm (http://missouri.box.com/v/rcss-mobaxterm) or Putty (https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w32/putty.exe)

*Homework 0*
  1. Homework 0-1: Using Secure Shell
     1. Connect to tc.rnet.missouri.edu with your pawprint (SSO) and pawprint password and run the following commands and copy and paste the session (as text).
        1. `hostname`
        1. `whoami |sum`
  2. Homework 0-2: What is an information system?
     1. What are the five components that make up an information system?
     2. Of the five primary components of an information system (hardware, software, data, people, process), which do you think is the most important to the success of a business organization? Write a one-paragraph answer to this question that includes an example from your personal experience to support your answer.

*Discussion 0-1:*
 * What are your first memories of using a computer to do computation (2 points)


### Hardware

*Reading*
 * Chapter 2/Hardware of ISBB (https://bus206.pressbooks.com/chapter/chapter-2/)

*Hands On*
 * We will be passing around various pieces of hardware today.

*Discussion*
 * What are bytes, characters (ASCII, Unicode, utf-8), files. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MijmeoH9LT4)
