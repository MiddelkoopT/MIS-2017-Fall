### Homework 1
  This homework will help you prepare for future homework.  A basic ability to work with the Linux shell will be a fundamental skill required in this class.
  
  1. Homework 1-1: Linux Shell
     1. Connect to the teaching cluster `tc.rnet.missour.edu`
     2. Create a series of folders to store and organize your class work, one of which will be for this class.
     3. In the class folder create a folder called 'module-1' and a sub-folder called 'linux-shell'
     4. In the class folder create a file called 'ReadMe.txt' and in and edit some text about this class.
     5. Create an empty file called 'Homework-1-1.txt' in the 'linux-shell' folder that will contain your submission for this homework.
     6. Make sure that your homework is not readable by your classmates (hint: file permissions).
     7. Place your answers to the following questions/tasks in the 'Homework-1-1.txt' file and copy the results into the class assignment for this homework.  Please copy the command (including the prompt) and the result.  You must copy and paste text and not use screen captures (images).
        1. Demonstrate (through the use of commands and their output) that your created the folders and files properly. Do not show 'how' they were created (for example the use of the `mkdir`command), show that they are indeed there.
        2. Show that your class files are not readable by anyone else but you.
        3. Demonstrate the use of the command `grep` on the file 'ReadMe.txt'
        4. Demonstrate the use of a pipe (`|`) with `grep`, `wc` or some other command.
        6. Demonstrate the use of some other command on your files.
