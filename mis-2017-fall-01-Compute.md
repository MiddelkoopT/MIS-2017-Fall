  1. Homework 1-1: Linux Shell
     1. Connect to the teaching cluster `tc.rnet.missour.edu`
     2. Create a series of folders to store and organize your class work, one of which will be for this class.
     3. In the class folder create a folder called 'module-1' and a sub-folder called 'linux-shell'
     4. In this folder create a file called 'ReadMe.txt' and in and edit some text about this class.
