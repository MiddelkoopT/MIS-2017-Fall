In Module 3 we will cover "Code" in information technology systems
including managing source code, programming, and how code is executed
and run in batch systems.  We will be covering the Python and Julia
languages and continue using SQL.  We will also be covering regular
expressions to process and filter data.

## Overview

In class we covered basic HTML and the importance of separating
content (HTML) and rendering (CSS) on web pages.  The website
https://www.w3schools.com/ is an excellent resource for learning and
reviewing HTML and CSS.

During class we covered the "Web Stack" of the Linux Apache MariaDB
PHP (LAMP) stack.  We covered the simple web request and processing,
how AJAX work, and how Internet Scale software works by separating
processing from the web.
